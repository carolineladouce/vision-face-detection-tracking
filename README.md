# Vision Face Detection Tracking

This is my implementation of the [Live Face Tracking](https://medium.com/onfido-tech/live-face-tracking-on-ios-using-vision-framework-adf8a1799233) tutorial by Anurag Ajwani (thanks Anurag!).  This project uses Swift, UIKit, AVFoundation, and Vision Framework.

## What I learned 
How to:

Make face detection requests using VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest

Convert image coordinates to screen coordinates in order to display face feature drawings on screen with appropriate proportions

Create CAShapeLayers from VNFaceObservation to draw face feature drawings

Render multiple face feature drawings that follow the users tracked features movement and display onscreen in real time
